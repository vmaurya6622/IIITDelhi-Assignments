# IIITDelhi-Assignments

**All the code in this Repository is in Python only**

Hello, my name is Vishal Kumar Maurya, and I am a student at IIIT Delhi, India, in the batch of 2022. During my first semester, I completed some
assignments given by the professors. While there may be bugs in my code, they should be easy to correct. Additionally, all of my code has
passed test cases checked by the respective TAs, so you can trust it to be reliable. :)

Here are some ways to use this repository effectively:

1. In every folder, I have provided the assignment sheet for the respective assignments, which you can use to check the answers/codes.
2. I have also provided some dummy/test files on which the code runs perfectly and executes effectively.
3. I have provided a good amount of comments in most of the files so that you can understand the code more easily.
4. I haven't taken care of time or space complexity because I wrote all of this code in my first semester, 
and DSA is in the second semester. I hope you can understand :->

Enjoy coding ! Thankyou so much ...
