Advantages of using OO
1. object oriented programming helps in defining the class with attributes, objcts etc.that helps in organising the data in a very good manner.
2. creating a new class is much easier and reliable. and defining and performing the operations over them are also liable.
3. adding a new object,attributes in the class is easy.

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. Dictionaries helps in getting the data at a very high access rate.
2. Actually adding entries in the dictionaries are tecnically flesible than adding into oops.


Disadvantage of using OO
1. The program length is more and the debug part of the program is more tough.
2. It is slower than other programs.

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1. dictionaries are unordered that prase the problem in getting the values by indexing.
2. dictionaries take up a lot more space than other data structures like oops.

Performance comparison for *grading* operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1200
2. Time by OO: 2.8651282787323
3. Time by dictionary: 3.5278801918029785
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is:  oo is more faster than dictionaries in grading by a fraction of 1.2313166631980328

Performance comparison for *search* operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1200  
2. Time by OO: 5.4389595462545665
3. Time by dictionary: 6.219196319580078
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: oo is faster in searching by a fraction of 1.743338870649174

({however this data can be somewhat inaccurate because performance comparison can depend on various factors such as the 
size of the data, hardware specifications, etc.})

Therefore, from my observations searching and grading operations are faster in object oriented programming....

thankyou !
