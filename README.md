# IIITDelhi-Assignments

**All the code in this repository is in Python only**

Hello i am Vishal Kumar Maurya **Student** at **IIIT Delhi, India**. In my first sem there were some assignments that were given by the prof.'s so i have
completed them on my way. Yes, there can be bugs in my code so you can correct them easily (should not be a big deal) that but all of my code passed test
cases checking by the respective TA's so you can trust over them ! they are reliable :) !.
Here are the ways to use this Repository effectively :-

1. In every folder i have provided the assignment sheet to the respective assignments. which you can use to check the answers/codes.
2. I have also provided some of the dummy/test files on which the code runs perfectly and executes effectively.
3. A good amount of comments are provided in most of the files so you can understand easily.
4. I haven't taken care of time or space complexity because i have done all this code in my first sem and DSA is in second sem so you can understand :>.
